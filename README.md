# TFG Mathematics Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code developed for my Final Degree Project (TFG) in Mathematics. The main objective of this project is to anaylize how simple boolean functions arising from the execution of Turing machines are.

## Project Description

...

## Getting Started

* Execute an experiment: from the `TFG-mates` directory execute `python -m src.main --experiment experimentX`, where `experimentX` is the name of the experiment you want to execute (e.g,. "experiment1").

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
