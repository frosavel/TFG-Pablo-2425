# TFG Mathematics Project: Analyzing 4-State Turing Machines

## Overview

This repository contains the code developed for my Final Degree Project (TFG) in Mathematics. The main objective of this project is [...]. An initial stage of this was to investigate whether whether the tape history functions of 4-state Turing machines exhibit "easy" behavior according to two key metrics: **entanglement** and **equanimity**.

## Project Description

In this project, we simulate and analyze 4-state Turing machines. The focus is on the evolution of the tape â€” the sequence of configurations (or tape history) that the machine produces during its execution. The analysis is based on the following metrics:

- **Entanglement:**  
  A measure of how the input bits of a boolean function are related to each other.

- **Equanimity:**  
  A metric that quantifies the importance of each input variable in relation to the final output.

By applying these metrics, the project aims to determine whether the tape history functions demonstrate "easy" behavior (i.e., less complex or more regular) compared to what might be expected from more intricate boolean functions.

## Getting Started
